# Visual E-Reader

This app simulates an e-reader with an instant "envisionment" capability. Select any passage of text to generate an image depicting that passage.

**Implementation**

The frontend and user interface for this app was developed using [Lovable](https://lovable.dev/).

The backend "envision" functionality was developed with assistance from [Cursor](https://cursor.com/).

**Installation**

You'll need Node.js & npm installed - [install with nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating) as well as Python for the backend.

Then:

Install the frontend dependencies:
`npm install`

Install the backend dependencies:
`npm run backend:install`

**How to Run**

Run the backend and frontend together:
`npm run dev:full`
